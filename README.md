A Minecraft-Like Little Game(or to say a redstone simulator), whose graphics and controls are similar to Minecraft.

Its code is a bit messy since that was a project I made a long time ago in a hurry.
If you want to run this on your computer, you'll probably need to establish the OpenGL environment yourself.
The project was created via DevC++, and some changes might be needed if you use another IDE.
